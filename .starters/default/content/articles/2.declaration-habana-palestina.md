# Palabra del Mundo from Habana to Palestina
[Ver versión en Español](declaracion-habana-palestina)

## I.

In the Holy Land, it is not only the existence of a people that is at stake at the hands of barbarism or the principles that govern coexistence and relations among human beings but the very foundations of the human spirit, treasured by civilization for centuries. The acceptance of boundless violence, the absolute cruelty, and coldness in the face of the death of our fellow human beings, without a start, without even a moment's tremor in the pulse of reason and the sensibility of the world--a prey to impotence and terror--, speak only of the decadence of our species as a paradigm in the face of blind nature and the shadowy forces of animal instinct. Such is the desolate landscape of our time.

In truth, the poet was right; we live in dark times, Bertold Brecht, immersed in the most excessive violence and greed, war and injustice, assumed as something fatal, inexorable, which is assumed from indifference and forgetfulness, amid a planetary program of market seduction, riddled by the mass media that propose their democracy as the best of all possible worlds that the well-designed marketing of evil and greed exhibit as the only destiny for mankind.


But even so, in this devastating panorama, we must not renounce to be heard; we must not renounce to strike the remotest fiber of human consciousness, to summon the moral reserves of civilization. We must not remain silent in the face of what the powers of capital propose to us, from blindness, anger, and arrogance. We must speak aloud and bear witness to our rejection of his designs. The human species must live in peace. To conquer science and cultivate harmony, to promote education and culture, to exalt the dignity of men and women, to work and fight to preserve life on earth.            

## II.

Thinking this way, we convene in Havana the Word of the World International Poetry Festival in the context of the 32nd Havana International Book Fair, which will be held from February 15 to 25, 2024.

We invite all poets who are willing to raise their voices for world peace and in solidarity with the people of Palestine, under occupation for decades, now brutally attacked by the Zionist state of Israel.

The appointment is in Havana from February 16 to 24. With poetry readings and our most energetic demonstration of solidarity, we will be on the side of those who suffer aggression, humiliation, and death in a genocidal action of ethnic cleansing and extermination of an entire people.


## III.

Poems can be submitted in video, audio, and as Word texts to be projected and read publicly at the Palabra del Mundo Poetry Festival of the Havana International Book Fair. At the end of this poetic action, the texts and audiovisual materials will be delivered to the Palestinian poets present at the event, members of the Palestine Writers' Union, the Palestinian Writers' Union, and the Palestine PEN Club, along with the list of names that support this poetic action in tribute to the land of Mahmoud Darwish.
¡Viva la Paz Mundial, Viva Palestina Libre! 

CubaPoesía Cultural Center, Havana, Cuba, December 31, 2023
