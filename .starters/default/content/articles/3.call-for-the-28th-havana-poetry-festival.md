# Call for the 28th Havana Poetry Festival

The CubaPoesía Cultural Center, the Poetry Section of the Association of Writers of the UNEAC, the Cuban Book Institute, the Ministry of Culture, the Casa del Alba Cultural, the Ibero-American Center of the Decima and the Improvised Verse, under the auspices of The World Poetry Movement, the South Cultural Project, the Latin American Literary Agency and the Cuban Chamber of the Book, convened the 28 International Poetry Festival of Havana and its Virtual Poetic Meeting, from May 4 to 28, 2022, on the centenary of the Cuban poets Carilda Oliver Labra and Jesús Orta Ruíz and the books “Tierra baldia”, by TS Elliot and “Trilce”, by César Vallejo.

With the Honorary Presidency of the great Cuban poet Nancy Morejón, National Literature Prize winner, the Festival will include the usual spaces "Itinerant CubaPoesía", "Verso amigo" and "Ismaelillo" for the promotion of reading among students, the Laboratory of Scriptures dedicated to the centenary of "Trilce" and "Wasteland" (Tierra baldía), and the Meeting of Poets in Defense of Humanity that, on this occasion will dedicate a space of privilege to the theme of "Love as a possibility of human redemption", in a world doomed to the extinction of the species, due to the pandemic, war, environmental depredation and greed that wastes nature's resources.

The invited authors must previously send their video recordings, which will be received (in English or Spanish), [using this link: http://u.pc.cd/UhyctalK](http://u.pc.cd/UhyctalK) until March 21, 2022. The videos will be 10 minutes long for poetry and song readings. 20 minutes for the interventions in the reflection forums.

Participants will be able to connect in real time to the Festival sessions through the event's Facebook page and the Casa del Alba Cultural ones, as well as through the YouTube channel of the Virtual Poetic Meeting, the Ministry of Culture of Cuba and the Casa del Alba; and through the CubaPoesía website of the International Poetry Festival, the Telegram channel and the profiles on Instagram and Twitter.
